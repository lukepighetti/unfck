# Unfck Your Life

Every life has ups and downs. If you find yourself stressed, struggling, anxious, or disenchanted, it might be time to *Unfck Your life*.

Unfck is a simple daily self-care tracker that follows best practices. You can hide goals, rename them, see your weekly progress, and add up to 5 custom items.

It's a Flutter PWA, so it can be installed without an app store (Share => Add To Home Screen) and Flutter creates a uniquely "app-like" PWA experience.
